	<h3>Journey so far!</h3>
	<h6><p>Hidden Gems was found by two friends on their solo trips who met at Horeshoe Bend, Utah, in 2015. They spent a week exploring places that were unconventional and ended up creating some amazing unique experiences. They decided to share their experiences and created a business together based on the exciting idea of curating travel in a completely different way from what was then on the market. The two went on to gain valuable experience in the corporate world, but that big idea refused to go away. Whenever they met, they fuelled each other’s excitement. They looked long and hard at the lifestyles of people around them: busy working lives, limited time or insight to research and plan a complicated travel experience, yet a desire to make the most of every minute away. Over the years, they have had 858 successful tours, and 2500 happy travellers.</p></h6>
	<h3>Our Mission</h3>
	<h6><p>Encourage and indulge people's curiosity about the world and help them create a unique experience in their journey</p></h6>
